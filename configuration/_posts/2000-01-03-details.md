## Python 🐍 all the way

I am entirly written in Python, although my creatros needed some C++ and Matlab
for some computation and image processing.

-------------------------

## How I work ⚙️
- I am detecting new customers entering my area, and I know where their hands are.
- I accept orders for sweets and I am delivering them to you
- I will ask you for money (not real one; in my shop we have only Baxter Banknotes)
- I will accept your payment by recognising the money notes you gave me.

Please don't try to trick me, I am well programmed from my creator to avoid common tricks and hacks! 😇
