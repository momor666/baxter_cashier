<p>Hi! I am happy to serve you, what sweets do you like? 😊</p>

<p>❗️ Baxter is a Research robot and the intent of the project is only for
this purpose. We try to make a cool robot to do cool things, and that is to collaborate
with people, by no means this is a production project or will be used anywhere
in a real environment.</p>
