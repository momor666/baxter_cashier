<h2>Python 🐍 all the way</h2>

<p>I am entirly written in Python, although my creatros needed some C++ and Matlab
for some computation and image processing.</p>

<hr />

<h2>How I work ⚙️</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I am detecting new customers entering my area, and I know where their hands are.</li>
  <li>I accept orders for sweets and I am delivering them to you</li>
  <li>I will ask you for money (not real one; in my shop we have only Baxter Banknotes)</li>
  <li>I will accept your payment by recognising the money notes you gave me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please don’t try to trick me, I am well programmed from my creator to avoid common tricks and hacks! 😇</p>
