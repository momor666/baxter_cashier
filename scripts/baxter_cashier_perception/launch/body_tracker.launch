    <!-- Important Note: By the maintainers of cob_people_perception library, the cob_openni2_tracker
    works best if the driver starts independetly rather than in this launch file. If you face any problems
    with the skeleton tracker, then comment the openni2_launch below and do it manually by running:
    roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch depth_registration:=true -->

    <!--  This starts the OpenNi2 driver and connect to the sensor. -->
    <include file="$(find openni2_launch)/launch/openni2.launch">

    </include>

    <!--  This launch the cob_openni2_tracker which implements the Skeleton Tracker -->
    <include file="$(find cob_openni2_tracker)/launch/body_tracker_nodelet.launch"/>

    <!-- This run the body_tracker_listener script implemented in this project. And receives data from
        the Skeleton Tracker -->
